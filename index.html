                <p>My name is Sydney Goldberger. I am from and currently living in New York City. I graduated 
                    from the Univeristy of Pennsylvania in 2017 with a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology and Fine Art.
                    After graduation, I worked at an experiential marketing company and then at IMG in Sports Media Rights.
                    I was craving a more creative enviornment and Therefore wanted to further my education in graphic design.
                    I just started my second semester in Parsons' AAS Communication Design Program.
                    I am a fairly new coder - I took my first class last semeseter (Core 1: Interaction).
                    I was extremely surprised with how much I enjoyed this course and as a result, I wanted to take a-generative-web.
                   In this class, I hope to grow further as a coder with my knowledge and skillset, but also as a thinker. 
                   I want to push myself and train my brain to think outside of the box within my code and ideas. Check out:

                    <p>After reading Paul Chan's <span id="articleName">Letter to Young Artists during a Pandemic</span>, I asked myself a simple question.
                        Where am I from? I grew up in New York City and therefore have a very strong tie to this magical place. Like 
                        most who grew up in the city that never sleeps, I inherently think that it is superior over all places. However, as I 
                        began to ask myself this simple question, I started to think about the concept of home. On this snowy Monday, I am 
                        reminded of my family's snow day traditions and rituals. I realize that the sledding in the park, 
                        the hot chocolate with marshmallows, and the pancakes for breakfast are the true definitions of home.
                        The relationship between the people, things, and memories that make a house feel like a home reminds me of 
                        the relationship between CSS and HTML. HTML is New York City: the bare bones of the home, the technicalities, the place. 
                        CSS is what makes a home unique with individualized memories and traditions: everyone's concept of home is styled differently.

                    <p>Jill Lepore's <span id="articleName">Can the Internet be Archived</span> forced me to think about Twitter's significant and historic role in the 2020 presidential 
                        election. Trump's excessive, devisive, and deranged Twitter usage was a huge part of the election's narrative. Without Trump's tweets, 
                        the story would have looked extremely different. What if in 10, 20, 30 or however many years, these tweets disappeared? How would 
                        future generations comprehend what occuredd? Would a historic view of the present look extremely different from its reality? I believe so.
                        I believe that without tangible records of what Trump wrote in his tweets, future generations would not be able to fully 
                        comprehend his character - or lack there of. Luckily for future generations, Twitter has committed to have all tweets archived in The Libarary of Congress. 
                        But what if Twitter did not made this promise? And are we saving too much? How does our process of archiving the past, 
                        present, and future of information that is spread by technological means compare to how those that came before us - without the use of the 
                        internet - saved information for future generatons?</p>

                        <p>Caroline Busta's <span id="articleName">The internet didn't kill counterculture - you just won't find it on Instagram</span>
                            was very thought provoking. Counterculture, according to Merriam-Webster, is defined as "a culture with values and mores 
                            that run counter to those of established society." Busta questioned whether or not counterculture truly exists in today's 
                            social media and internet driven society. The internet is a place that enables personal expression for all users. What does 
                            having power on the internet and/or social media really mean today? Is it having a verrified account? Is it having followers? 
                            Is it having a voice? Or is it what the user does with their voice? Busta believes that the power lies in the control of 
                            "the means by which lesser power can be displayed. Actual power owns social media." So perhaps no average 
                            internet or social media user actually has power. And if they users don't truly have power, can they really ever be countercultural?

                                from a tool that we use to a place where we live." After reading this quote, I paused and thought about this simple statement's complete and 
                                utter accuracy. We don't use technology as a device to solve problems, we use it as a means to exist, to evolve, to transform ourselves. 
                                Technology has become a persona, and the way that we use technology has become a narriatve. How do we shape the story so that we use
                                technology for good? Or is it too late? Chimero suggests that since tehcnology has become a home, a place, an enviornment, we 
                                need "choose to be in lively and nourshing digital environments." This article forced me to examine the digital spaces in which I currently live
                                becuase if I don't enjoy living in these spaces, why do I?

                                <p><span id="articleName">Jodi's Infrastructure</span> by Alexander R. Galloway questioned whether one thinks of themselves as working "on" the 
                                    digital or "within" the digital. Is the digital at the core of your work or is the digital just related to your work?
                                    I really thought about this question and couldn't come up with an answer. As a graphic designer, the computer is the way in which 
                                    I complete my work - all of the programs that I use purely exist on the computer. However, is the ethos of the work that I create 
                                    directly linked to my computer? Would the essence of the work change if the computer changed? Is the context of the computer becoming my content?
                                    Or is my content providing its own individual context, detached from the computer? </p>

                                    <p>Silvio Lorusso's<span id="articleName"> The User Condition: Computer Agency and Behavior</span> touches on ideas surrounding agency, labor, work, and 
                                    action. The reading brought up the idea of the computer being a world within a world and questioned the agency that individuals have within and surrounding
                                    its digital ecosystem. I found Lorusso's piece very theoretical and philosphical and as a result, I did not completely grasp every aspect of the reading. 
                                    What I did take away from the piece was that the computer questions the boundaries that the traditional definition of agency provides to individuals in 
                                    a non-digital world. What does it truly mean to have agency in present day society? How can we combat the social pressures that both control and limit 
                                    one's agency? Lorusso redefines agency as "the capacity for action, which is in turn the ability to interrupt behavior." But in a world where the digital 
                                    is taking over every day actions, work, and labor, can agency truly exist?

                                        <p>I am having a hard time conceptually visualizing my project. I am a very literal thinker, so this exercise
                                            is pushing me to think beyond my comfort zone. I know I want my project to revolve around the ever changing news cycle
                                            and user's documentation of present day events. How can the way in which we use technology record
                                            worldly events and news? How can daily user inputs document history in a manner that literature, newspapers, and other news sources can't?
                                            What can the curiousity and informational desires of users tell us about our society? I want to be able to archive both the most common daily interests 
                                            of users from around the world as well as archive the individual intersts of users and compare the two. Perhaps we will learn something
                                            about ourselves and additionally provide another archival piece of history from which future generations can analyze and learn. But the question is - 
                                            how can I do this? I need signifcant support in understanding how to impliment the correct API as well as utilize the data. I also need to conceptually resolve
                                            the data visualization of my project.

                                        <p>I immediately thought of the game of chess while reading<span id="articleName"> Concept Design Games Book Two: Playing.</span> 
                                         According to the reading, control is the central concept "to all making, using, and designing of artifacts." Control sits in the place
                                         that enables us to choose the placement of things and the way in which they are placed. Control is therefore influenced by interaction:
                                         it is by interacting with others that we can exercise control over one another. In order to be a master chess player, one must be able to 
                                         successfully move one's own pieces and predict the movement of one's opponent's pieces. This is all done in silence - like the Silent 
                                         Game described in the reading. Action is the sole form of interaction and communication. Moreover, the game of chess demonstrates
                                         how control realy lies in the ability to take autonomy away from an opponent, or taking away control from others. Therefore, control is not only
                                         the ability to control oneself and one's decisions, but it is also the ability to control the decisions of others. The following quote 
                                         particuarly stuck with me: "Control is part of all games; making a game baased on a concept is to express the concept in terms of control." 
                                         If life is a big game, then our ability to survive and succeed in society is determined by the strength of our control over ourselves, our 
                                         choices, and our interaction with others. What does that say about us?

                                        <p>Amanda K. Greene's <span id="articleName">Data Sweat</span> describes the importance of "Digital 
                                            Exhaust" - metadata that is generated by our online interactions and usage. Greene explains
                                            that it is not only the posts that we as indivduals hand select to share with the world that provide information.
                                            It is also the behind-the-scenes interactions between humans and technology that tell a story. The ways in which
                                            we interact with our devices and online platforms i.e. "where users click, how long they look at a page, where 
                                            the mouse-cursor hovers, what they type, and more" translate into feelings that are more telling than our curated posts. 
                                            These emotions provide understanding of ourselves, society, and each other. It is not what we post, but what we don't post and 
                                            how we actually interact with other posts that provide the most insight. Greene explains that "this 'passive' type of metadata
                                            is profoundly embodied in even deeper ways than many of the things we intentionally publish." This concept is very relatable - 
                                            every time I use social media or technology, I will be reminded that how I am interacting with what I see is more telling 
                                            than what I actually choose to show the world.
