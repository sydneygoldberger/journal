                <p>My name is Sydney Goldberger. I am from and currently living in New York City. I graduated 
                    from the Univeristy of Pennsylvania in 2017 with a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology and Fine Art.
                    After graduation, I worked at an experiential marketing company and then at IMG in Sports Media Rights.
                    I was craving a more creative enviornment and Therefore wanted to further my education in graphic design.
                    I just started my second semester in Parsons' AAS Communication Design Program.
                    I am a fairly new coder - I took my first class last semeseter (Core 1: Interaction).
                    I was extremely surprised with how much I enjoyed this course and as a result, I wanted to take a-generative-web.
                   In this class, I hope to grow further as a coder with my knowledge and skillset, but also as a thinker. 
                   I want to push myself and train my brain to think outside of the box within my code and ideas. Check out:

                <div id="entryText">
                    <p>After reading Paul Chan's <span id="articleName">Letter to Young Artists during a Pandemic</span>, I asked myself a simple question.
                        Where am I from? I grew up in New York City and therefore have a very strong tie to this magical place. Like 
                        most who grew up in the city that never sleeps, I inherently think that it is superior over all places. However, as I 
                        began to ask myself this simple question, I started to think about the concept of home. On this snowy Monday, I am 
                        reminded of my family's snow day traditions and rituals. I realize that the sledding in the park, 
                        the hot chocolate with marshmallows, and the pancakes for breakfast are the true definitions of home.
                        The relationship between the people, things, and memories that make a house feel like a home reminds me of 
                        the relationship between CSS and HTML. HTML is New York City: the bare bones of the home, the technicalities, the place. 
                        CSS is what makes a home unique with individualized memories and traditions: everyone's concept of home is styled differently.

                    <p>Jill Lepore's <span id="articleName">Can the Internet be Archived</span> forced me to think about Twitter's significant and historic role in the 2020 presidential 
                        election. Trump's excessive, devisive, and deranged Twitter usage was a huge part of the election's narrative. Without Trump's tweets, 
                        the story would have looked extremely different. What if in 10, 20, 30 or however many years, these tweets disappeared? How would 
                        future generations comprehend what occuredd? Would a historic view of the present look extremely different from its reality? I believe so.
                        I believe that without tangible records of what Trump wrote in his tweets, future generations would not be able to fully 
                        comprehend his character - or lack there of. Luckily for future generations, Twitter has committed to have all tweets archived in The Libarary of Congress. 
                        But what if Twitter did not made this promise? And are we saving too much? How does our process of archiving the past, 
                        present, and future of information that is spread by technological means compare to how those that came before us - without the use of the 
                        internet - saved information for future generatons?</p>

                        <p>Caroline Busta's <span id="articleName">The internet didn't kill counterculture - you just won't find it on Instagram</span>
                            was very thought provoking. Counterculture, according to Merriam-Webster, is defined as "a culture with values and mores 
                            that run counter to those of established society." Busta questioned whether or not counterculture truly exists in today's 
                            social media and internet driven society. The internet is a place that enables personal expression for all users. What does 
                            having power on the internet and/or social media really mean today? Is it having a verrified account? Is it having followers? 
                            Is it having a voice? Or is it what the user does with their voice? Busta believes that the power lies in the control of 
                            "the means by which lesser power can be displayed. Actual power owns social media." So perhaps no average 
                            internet or social media user actually has power. And if they users don't truly have power, can they really ever be countercultural?
